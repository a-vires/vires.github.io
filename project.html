            'The Esper Network'
            The future of transportation is now here!
            </p>

            <p>
            Imagine a digital world, where owners of electronic vehicles can share their autonomous vechicles on the 'Esper' network operated by Blockchain Technology.
            The future of transportation is now here! Sadly, We just don't know it yet. Shareholders and owners of electronic vehicles will get a 5% cut from every successful rideshare completion.
            </p>
                
<p>The key motivation for my project is to reduce the risk of deaths on our roads while keeping 'investors' happy. A win-win-situation for all parties, building a company-inside-a-company. 
With all potential risks, T&C's accepted by the end-user upon entery of the eletric vechical, (there will be a digital ipad displayed on the door of the EV).
</p>

<p>
The goal is to prevent less deaths on the road by removing 'idiots' from our streets.
Honestly, since everything is self-driving and connected on a blockchain network, there would be less issues, less carbon emissions and less human-error.
</p>

<p>
Its about time artificial intelligence is stepping up and taking over! 
Electric vehicles currently uses lazer beams, software detection, hard coded obstacle avoidance algorithms, predictive modeling and smart object discrimination.
A key example is: knowing the difference between a bicycle and a motorcycle. 
Current EV software helps track trafic congestion and reduce human navigation errors by presenting the shortest path possible from A-Z.
</p>

<p>
Thesed days, fully autonomous vehicles dont even offer a steering wheel, but they do offer detrimental effects.
Essentially this means, self driving cars are at the point where they can safely drive under ideal conditions but if it was snowing and the sensors are covered in ice they can produce major vulnerability issues, as many manufactures are trying to make
a serious of redundancies, making sure if one system fails there's other systems to pick up the slack.
</p>

<p>
One of Ubers self driving prototypes killed a pedestrian in 2018, this was a huge public relations setback for the whole industry. On top of the list of technological features, scientists are using AI to teach cars how to drive.
A model designed by MIT and Microsoft researchers indentifies, driving training examples don't match what's actually happening in the real world. 
We need engineers to use this model to impoove the safety of artifical intelligence systems.
 <a class="sub-text" href="https://electrek.co/2018/03/19/uber-self-driving-prototyp-fatal-crash-police/" target="_blank">https://electrek.co/2018/03/19/uber-self-driving-prototyp-fatal-crash-police/</a>

Its easier said then done, as these driver precautions dont ensure driver safety.
</p>
 
<p>
Hence why we need the tool's and technologies of 'Software Developers' to push innovation forward!
We need Engineers to design multi agent systems, and blockchain networks!
We need more experts in machine learning and artificial intelligence!
The tools and technologies of lazer beams, software detection, hard coded obstacle avoidance algorithms, predictive modeling and smart object discrimination.
</p>

<p>
In addition, these cars use lidar sensors to help detect edges of the road and identify land markings by bouncing pulses of light around the cars surroundings. 
Lidar is a method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances from an object controlled by a computer thats connected to a 'blockchain network'.
</p>

<p>
Very extreme and effective systems, think about it: If every car was replaced with autonomous vechciels, there would be less accidents. There will be no 'uber' or 'lift drivers' only autonomous 'esper cabs'.
Yes, there will be some accidents and people will still die as a result, however, estimates say 90% of trafic fatalities around the would can be prevented with autonomous vehicles. See reference:

</p>
 <a class="sub-text" href="https://www.sciencealert.com/driverless-cars-could-reduce-traffic-fatalities-by-up-to-90-says-report" target="_blank">https://www.sciencealert.com/driverless-cars-could-reduce-traffic-fatalities-by-up-to-90-says-report</a>

<p>
Yes, Autonomous cars need to rechage but they dont need to sleep nor take breaks. Advanced algorithms are singlely or duel-minded, meaning they can carry out large amounts of instructions called data-sets in their programing. As humans we cannot store large amounts of information and tend to fall asleep at the wheel due to fatigue.
These consequences are both costly and deadly.
According to the 'Association for safe international road travel' Nearly 1.3 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day. See reference:

<p>
Hence why we need the tool's and technologies of 'Software Developers' to push innovation forward!
Our Engineers need to be able to design multi-agent-systems, and work with current blockchain technologies and machine learning experts to design unique algorithms.
</p>

<p>
Eletric vehicles uses advance metrics and predictive modeling so we need engineer's who know machine learning and artificial intelligence as real time event driven systems are in high demand.
Electric vehicles currently uses lazer beams, software detection, hard coded obstacle avoidance algorithms, predictive modeling and smart object discrimination.
Having expeirence in streamline processing systems and designing large-scale distributed systems is a must!
The feasibility of this would be having more students graduate in the field of Software Engineering, Computer Science and IT. 
A degree in the field is not necessary but the willingness to learn & have a strong passion for innovation and IT is heavily favored. If the applicant can demonstate good teamwork and practical knowledge.
